# ART-STORE
Web-based platform that allows artists to sell their artwork directly to customers. The platform could feature a user-friendly interface for uploading and managing artwork, as well as tools for setting prices, managing orders, and tracking sales.

This Project is a completely FREE OPEN-SOURCE project.

The project could leverage existing frameworks as Next.js or Bootsrtap storefront and integrate payment gateways.
